But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
a living soul
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
knowledge of good and evil
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold
        And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates
        But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die
        And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him
